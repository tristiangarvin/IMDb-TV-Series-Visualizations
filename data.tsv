69	1	2	Mountains	25 Mar. 2007	8.8	3,447	Mountains are the most prominent products of the immense forces which shape the living planet: tectonic drift, volcanic activity and erosion by wind, water, frost and precipitation.

71	1	4	Caves	22 Apr. 2007	8.8	3,073	The Earth's large, deep calcareous caves are virtually inaccessible and therefore barely explored - requiring expert diving where flooded.

72	1	5	Deserts	1 Apr. 2007	8.7	2,937	A large and growing part of earth's land mass is covered in desert - each one widely varied in composition and dryness. Wildlife species have adapted in different ways to these different arid lands especially to get and conserve water. Some are physically desert-models, like camels, others just changed their diet and behavior. Most live mainly at night, when it's cooler. The largest desert is northern Africa's Sahara, US size and extremely sandy, the result of grinding erosion of mountains. Short moist moments or periods are taken intense advantage off, leading to ...	tt0795176	Planet Earth
73	1	6	Ice Worlds	1 Apr. 2007	8.9	2,890	The polar caps have the most extreme seasonal contrasts, growing and melting vast ice masses, so wildlife adapts by annual migrations. The majority of Antartica is a vast barren permafrost. Only 3% of the coast and peninsular peaks are where life migrates to in the spring, for a short fertile summer, attracted by rich supplies of krill and fish. Only the Emperor penguin males breed 4 months in winter 100 miles inland. The Arctic has a more complete fauna which migrates back North from the continent. Here, the Polar bear is threatened because global warming defrosts ...	tt0795176	Planet Earth
74	1	7	Great Plains	8 Apr. 2007	8.7	2,726	A quarter of the earth's land mass, from arctic to tropical, are open plains consisting of lowland as well as highland plateaus. Here grows virtually indestructible, fast-growing grasses of all sizes that feed the planet's largest herbivore populations, the preys to solitary and social carnivores. Spectacular elements of the seasonal cycle of life can include mass migrations, monsoons, drought and great fires.	tt0795176	Planet Earth
75	1	8	Jungles	8 Apr. 2007	8.9	2,807	On 3% of the Earth's surface, the rain forest is the habitat for half our animal species, even 80% of insects. So its wildlife is most competitive, like the birds of paradise's mating, and specialized with unique relationships of predation, parasitism etc. For plants, the quest for light is key to stratification, paralleled by interacting animals eating fruits, leaves and other animals. Even the jungle cacophony is stratified. On the soil, recycling specialist like fungi restart the cycle of life. In Central Africa even herds of elephants specialize in following ...	tt0795176	Planet Earth
76	1	9	Shallow Seas	8 Apr. 2007	8.8	2,679	Shallow seas cover only 8% of earth's surface, but contain the richest, most varied maritime life: from plankton and coral (literally vital for the very existence of reefs) to birds and from various invertebrates to mammals like seals, dolphins and whales and from sea snakes to countless fish species. Their ecological interaction is greatly varied and complex, often with nearby land to, even with deserts.	tt0795176	Planet Earth
77	1	10	Seasonal Forests	22 Apr. 2007	8.8	2,582	Trees are earth's largest organisms and are also one of the planet's oldest inhabitants. Seasonal forests (unlike tropical rain-forest) the largest land habitats. A third of all trees grow in the endless taiga of the Arctic north. Northern America has forests that include California's sequoia's, the earth's largest trees. There and elsewhere, their vast production of photosynthesis and shade presides over a seasonal cycle of life and involves countless plant and animal species.	tt0795176	Planet Earth
78	1	11	Ocean Deep	25 Mar. 2007	8.9	2,658	Open ocean, a vast biotope covering two thirds of the planet, some shallow, some as deep as the mountain ranges are high. The ocean has an immense, precariously complex food chain, varying from microscopic animals, like krill, to whales, which ironically feed mainly on the former. Most species swim or float in it, many coming up for air, while other dive in from land or air, often to feed, but also to procreate on the coast, where some species come to lay their eggs. Even the shore is covered with life, largely based on organic matter, such as corpses.	tt0795176	Planet Earth

1312	1	1	Oceans: Into the Blue	13 Jan. 2011	8.6	493	Nearly all human populations in coastal areas interact intensively with the sea. The food harvest is enormous, varied and obtained in various, sometimes ingenious ways, including cooperation with wild dolphins. Dangers and scarcity worsen for environmental reasons, climate change bodes even worse. Aquatic sports are also culturally important, sometimes even defining.	tt1806234	Human Planet
1313	1	2	Deserts: Life in the Furnace	20 Jan. 2011	8.5	415	Deserts cover a third of the earth's land mass, yet harbor only some 300,000 inhabitants, many of which are (semi-)nomadic hunters/herdsmen, making navigation and adapted animals, such as camels, vital. The only 7,000 years old Sahara, the planet's vastest sand-pan, counts many tribes. The stony Gobi enjoys melting snow, wind-transported in all the way from Siberia, but also counts roaming wolves. In the most arid Araucana, capturing the rare precipitation is an extremely refined art.	tt1806234	Human Planet
1314	1	3	Arctic: Life in the Deep Freeze	27 Jan. 2011	8.7	415	In the vast icy wastes of the Arctic very little grows. It's dark for months in the winter and the freezing temperatures make it particularly inhospitable. Yet four million people live there thanks to ingenious survival techniques passed down through generations. In Greenland, where food is hard to come by and dogs are a crucial means of transport, Amos and his son Karl-Frederik embark on a remarkable journey across the frozen sea. They then fish for the giant Greenland shark by drilling a hole through the ice. This is food that will keep their precious dogs going for...	tt1806234	Human Planet
1315	1	4	Jungles: People of the Trees	3 Feb. 2011	8.8	411	Although a mall part of earth's landmass, tropical rain forests contain half the animal species, mainly on altitudes out of human reach, losing 100 a day, often undiscovered, trough rapid wood-cut, clearing for agriculture etcetera. The rare surviving native tribal jungle cultures go to great lengths to remain in ecological harmony with wildlife and cope with dangers and others challenges, such as hight, while basically eating what they can catch, from honey to tarantulas.	tt1806234	Human Planet
1316	1	5	Mountains: Life in Thin Air	10 Feb. 2011	8.6	359	Life in the mountains demands elaborate adaptations, for despite the extreme biological diversity people often have little choice of meat supply, despite elaborate hunting methods such as nets in clearings to lure giant bats. In developed regions, modern technology helps control avalanches. Relative isolation comes at a price, as for health care, and leads to bizarre traditions, such as Buddhist 'air burial' which actually means relying on vultures to dispose of corpses before they spread diseases.	tt1806234	Human Planet
1317	1	6	Grasslands: The Roots of Power	17 Feb. 2011	8.4	345	Grass lands cover vast plains, such as savanna, prairies and pampas. The many, almost indestructible grass species, for various types of soil and other conditions, feed huge herds, whose migrations are followed by many predators and (semi-)nomadic peoples, such as the Mongol master horsemen. Some still practice hunting-gathering, such as the Khoisan, or traditional 'natural' herd breeding, others as in Australia use technology to gain maximal control. Domesticating cereals and edible grazers was crucial in human history, leading to vast food surpluses and sedentary ...	tt1806234	Human Planet
1318	1	7	Rivers: Friend and Foe	24 Feb. 2011	8.5	343	Man always was attracted by rivers, not unlike seas, for water, fishing, irrigation, transport. And he deals in many ways with their dangers, ranging from torrents, frost and perilous crossing to floods. Most lack moder technology, hence are reduced to minimal control, rather adapting to the tide then controlling it.	tt1806234	Human Planet
1319	1	8	Cities: Surviving the Urban Jungle	3 Mar. 2011	8.1	337	Urban environments are man-made, so human design seems totally to overtake wildlife habitats. Yet animals abound in cities and suburbs, many as pets or working, but others exempt by religion or even able to pursue their natural life with some fancy adapting, as many animals do in the wild.	tt1806234	Human Planet
1320	1	1	To the Ends of the Earth	18 Mar. 2012	8.7	839	David Attenborough travels from the Arctic to the Antarctic to discover magical new ice worlds inhabited by the most extraordinary animal survivors on Earth.	tt2092588	Frozen Planet
1321	1	2	Spring	18 Mar. 2012	8.5	749	Each spring, massive sweet water thawing rapidly transforms the polar regions and the surrounding seas, where broken-off ice floats to. This is crucial in the life cycle of many species, sometimes extremely elaborate. Many colonies (re)unite to mate, hatch and/or start raising offspring, especially in 'temperate' parts, such as South Georgia island.	tt2092588	Frozen Planet
1322	1	3	Summer	25 Mar. 2012	8.2	681	In Summer, the non-stop sunlight fires an unrelenting thaw, transforming much of the polar regions into fertile land and open sea, while immense masses of melted sweet water pour into the oceans. Many species profit from the relatively benign conditions to mate, breed and raise their young. However for some, such as ice-bears, the lack of ice also causes major troubles in foraging and just moving around.	tt2092588	Frozen Planet
1323	1	4	Autumn	16 Nov. 2011	8.3	660	After non-stop summer months, the polar regions have expanded maximally, abundant food turns even the bears sociable. However the shortening of days soon starts reversing the process as frost expands the ice again. So many seasonal migrations turn too, mainly leaving for warmer regions. A stunning exception are the 'giant' emperor penguins, who arrive to mate, lay and raise their eggs in heroic defiance of the planet's harshest conditions.	tt2092588	Frozen Planet
1324	1	5	Winter	1 Apr. 2012	8.6	668	The polar struggle to survive is even harder in winter, missing a single rare prey can be lethal. Well-adapted anatomy is crucial, but also tricks such as isolation with snow or preys' fur. The Antarctic is nearly deserted, except for seals and emperor penguins, even the slightly milder Artic is left by most species, failing to do so is a gamble which can exterminate entire populations.	tt2092588	Frozen Planet
1325	1	6	The Last Frontier	15 Apr. 2012	8.2	629	The polar regions are earth's least hospitable environment, yet people live in the Arctic regions. Modern urbanized life is possibly even there thanks to technology, but some (often tribal) communities still practice traditional methods, dependent on specific fauna, such as reindeer herding, dog sleds, hunting seals and collecting bird eggs. Some of those are even used by modern patrols in mineral-rich parts, e.g. in Greenland. The even harsher Antartic, were territorial claims are frozen, remains off-limits for exploitation, except controlled eco-friendly tourism and...	tt2092588	Frozen Planet

And after stopping off at Boycie's car lot they spy a Mark II Cortina that's being used as a part-exchange for a Vanden Plas. Del knocks the asking price down to £25, so long as he houses Boycie's E type jag for a week - Del hopes to use the Jag to impress his bit on the side. Del ups the price tag of the Cortina to £199 and gets interest from an Australian buyer. And with cash in their pockets, a Jag to drive, and both of them single, Rodney talks Del into heading off for a night on the tiles. The Trotters' night ...	tt0081912	Only Fools and Horses

1374	1	1	The Cause (1861)	23 Sep. 1990	8.6	442	Slavery began to flourish in the U.S. at the end of the 18th century with Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin. Whereas it would take one person a day to produce a pound of clean cotton, the cotton gin could produce 1000 lbs per day. Business boomed and the demand for slaves to work new cotton fields rose accordingly. Serious objections to slavery began as early as 1831 and the abolitionist movement in the North grew quickly. There was particular concern about whether new States entering the Union would be free or slave States. Some, like John Brown, added ...	tt0098769	The Civil War

Battles had taken a horrendous toll in human lives on both sides. Lincoln and his Cabinet were frustrated by the slow pace of the war and with Gen. George B. McClellan who apparently did not want to engage the enemy. The eventual attack on the Confederate capital, Richmond - by transporting Union troops by boat to the peninsula southeast of Confederate capital - was met by stiff resistance from a force one-tenth its size. McClellan dug in at ...	tt0098769	The Civil War

Stuart in northwestern Virginia. Lee was named commander of the army of Northern Virginia and immediately seized the initiative and attacked McClellan at Mechanicsville. Growing increasingly frustrated at McClellan's lack of progress, Lincoln visited him on the battlefield. When the general told the President that hew needed yet more troops, Lincoln ordered him to withdraw. Cotton production was cut in the south hoping this would spur the major ...	tt0098769	The Civil War

Some 200 men were deserting every day and by January one-quarter of the men were AWOL. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, the new Union commander, wanted to take Fredericksburg but delays in getting the pontoon boats to cross the Rappahannock river allowed Lee to amass 75,000 men. The Union army was blown away and 9,000 men were killed. Elsewhere, the Confederate army was matching this success and a Union flotilla was captured. Lincoln called for more troops and in ...	tt0098769	The Civil War

Lee invaded Pennsylvania and over three days 150,000 men would do battle at Gettysburg. Confederate soldiers had gone into Gettysburg as they had heard there was a large supply of shoes available. The town soon became the focus of the battle that would shape the rest of the conflict.

The second day focused on positioning leading to the battle of Little Round Top. an ...	tt0098769	The Civil War

President Lincoln named U.S. Grant the overall commander of the Union army, 533,000 strong and the largest army in the world. He was made a three star Lieutenant General, a rank last held by George Washington. He brought a different approach than his predecessors, choosing to aggressively pursue Lee's army, realizing that to do so would likely see them take control of Richmond. Success was not assured and did not come quickly. Their first encounter went to Lee, but Grant used a ...	tt0098769	The Civil War
1380	1	7	Most Hallowed Ground (1864)	26 Sep. 1990	8.5	314	By the summer of 1864, the Union push had been stopped. At Petersburg, Union troops had been entrenched in an intricate network trenches for two months. The key to victory lay in Sherman capturing Atlanta and on July 22, the battle began and by September, Confederate Gen. Hood abandoned the city. In Virginia, Gen. Sheridan was laying waste to the Shenandoah Valley. For Lincoln, he faced an election in the midst of a civil war, something unknown at the time. Lincoln seemed unelectable and the Democrats were running the ousted Gen McClellan as their candidate. The ...	tt0098769	The Civil War
1381	1	8	War Is All Hell (1865)	27 Sep. 1990	8.8	308	By the beginning of 1865, the Confederacy was coming to an end. Atlanta had been overrun and Sherman was marching to the sea. Lincoln approved Sherman's plan against the advice of those around him. Sherman set fire to Atlanta, burning anything that could be of use to the opposition. With 62,000 men, he set off toward Savannah. While Sherman went south, the bulk of the Confederate army outside Virginia was destroyed at the battle of Franklin, Tenn. and by early January, Sherman turned northward into the Carolinas. In Virginia meanwhile, Lee's army was under-equipped ...	tt0098769	The Civil War
1382	1	9	The Better Angels of Our Nature (1865)	27 Sep. 1990	8.9	316	The North celebrated Lee's surrender and the end of the war. On April 14, Good Friday, John Wilkes Booth learned that President Lincoln, General Grant and others were to attend a play at the Ford theater. The Grants decided not to attend and left Washington for Philadelphia. Booth shot the President in the back of the head, and Lincoln died the next day at 7:22 a.m. The news flashed across the country via the telegraph and celebration turned to sorrow. Scattered fighting continued into May but on May 23, a victory parade was held in Washington. By July, eight of ...	tt0098769	The Civil War

Conniving political advisor Malcolm Tucker comes up with a solution. He must resign before he is fired and thus seem to be doing the decent thing. Cliff's replacement is Hugh Abbot, well-meaning and anxious to instigate his Snooper Force, issuing honest press releases irrespective of government directives. Policy advisors Ollie and Glenn are called in to make a compromise. Tucker is horrified and has his own response.	tt0459159	The Thick of It
6857	1	2	Episode #1.2	26 May 2005	8.1	544	As press secretary Terri piles more departmental press releases on Hugh's desk, hard-hitting journalist Simon Hewitt publicly denounces his ability and Tucker is aghast to find out how ignorant Hugh is of popular culture, providing him with an idiot's guide tape. Ollie decides there should be a focus group and that they should be guided by a representative of middle England - Mary. Hugh is charmed by her.

Glenn suggests he tries to sell his flat in Notting Hill before the bill is read. Hugh hopes for some friendly publicity from the usually sympathetic journalist Angela Heaney but she is unimpressed by the dual ownership and it needs Tucker to deal with her.	tt0459159	The Thick of It

At the same time Ollie is dating a woman who is an advisor for the opposition party in the hopes that he will act as Tucker's spy.

6860	2	2	Episode #2.2	27 Oct. 2005	7.8	425	Following a cabinet reshuffle Julius Nicholson, an outside advisor, arrives to investigate the policies of all the major departments. Tucker is outraged and sees it as his job to be obstructive. Learning that the P.M.'s wife is known for her dislike of him and with his appearance on 'Question Time' fallen through, Hugh aims to soften up the press by throwing a party, only to find that Nicholson is doing the same. This really is the time for Tucker to start those Chinese whispers and put paid to Nicholson.	tt0459159	The Thick of It

The department has a new name, the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, though they seem to be dealing with issues no other departments want.

He is one of the 'Nutters', the group keen to take power when the P.M. resigns and keen to make a name for himself - which he does in the wrong sense when Jeremy Paxman skewers him on 'Newsnight'. This is music to Tucker's ears as it is in his interest for the P.M. to remain in power for as long as he can. Ollie's new girlfriend Emma is working for Shadow Minister Peter Mannion and hopes to impress by stealing one of Ollie's idea for use on their ...	tt0459159	The Thick of It

Unfortunately only one person is interested in taking on the post, obscure junior minister Nicola Murray. True she is very keen but she also has a fear of lifts, a husband whose firm gets government contracts and a daughter about to start at a private school. Tucker is appalled but the only other likely candidate is his left bollock with a smiley face on it so he has to steer Nicola very carefully through a by-election poster...	tt0459159	The Thick of It
6866	3	2	Episode #3.2	31 Oct. 2009	8.4	381	Nicola has been in post for a week and already the press are doubting her competence. So it is not a good time to learn that 'somebody' in the department has accidentally wiped the immigration records of 170,00 people over the past few months. Nicola has a press meeting with hostile Guardian journalists coming up and Tucker must ensure that they do not get to learn of the mistake.

Glenn meets Julie Price, a tragic widow whose situation could be useful to Nicola but when Tucker tries to beef up the story it leads to a fight with Glenn - which Julie leaks on Twitter.

Pearson is desperate to bring old style Tory Mannion into the twenty-first century but Mannion is the only one of the party unenthusiastic about the visit. Terri is looking forward to new blood taking over the building but for Nicola, anxious to push through her Fourth Sector Path-finder policy, the visit is just another unwelcome diversion to add to the phone calls from her mother and her daughter's school.	tt0459159	The Thick of It

Nicola does not do well with her idea of ""being inspired out of poverty"" and Mannion, despite Phil's sycophantic praise, fares no better.

6871	3	7	Episode #3.7	5 Dec. 2009	8.5	367	Nicola is keen to find a famous sports person to front her Healthy Choices campaign but Tucker is officially on holiday - or rather recovering from the result of his spat with Terri. Thus new spin doctor Steve Fleming is brought in and whilst Ollie may regard him as a saviour this is the man Tucker once drummed out of the party. The last thing he wants is to give his old adversary power over him so he hosts a cosy lunch for the press, stressing that, whatever people think, he is still in charge.	tt0459159	The Thick of It

Spin doctor Stewart Pearson, on PM's orders, instructs him to launch an education initiative, to the annoyance of junior minister Fergus and the embittered Glenn. Glenn is supported by Terri, who is fed up and wants redundancy. Peter's brief is to launch an Apps initiative in a local school but the press conference shows him to be wholly out of touch with the subject. Ultimately he must reconcile with Fergus at a further press call to gain street cred - and just about does it.	tt0459159	The Thick of It
6874	4	2	Episode #4.2	15 Sep. 2012	7.9	317	Nicola is the leader of the opposition and, with Glenn gone, her new policy advisor is Helen Hatley. As Remembrance Sunday approaches Nicola feels the party should be realistic and agree with two unpopular policies of the government that they previously opposed. Tucker is appalled - as are the rest of the party - and things get worse when the press photograph Helen on the street with the notes from the policy meeting. Tucker is supportive - to her face but is secretly grooming Dan Miller, as he feels Nicola will commit political suicide soon anyway. And her ...	tt0459159	The Thick of It

Back at the ministerial office Phil finds the place deserted except for Glenn, still working on the Fourth Sector for Nicola, and Fergus and his advisor Adam, who are talking to economist Tara. Then the news breaks that anti-government protester Tickel has killed himself. Everybody rushes to inform Mannion, who can only get a phone signal on his mobile by standing on a children's slide - in which embarrassing pose he is photographed.

Tipped off by Glenn, Nicola offers Ben the role of shadow chancellor but Ollie, in hospital after a burst appendix, and persuaded by Tucker, prevails upon Glenn to find an email to discredit Nicola. It also incriminates Swain, leading to his being duped into resigning, whilst denouncing Nicola, who also stands down as leader with ...	tt0459159	The Thick of It

Adam and Fergus persuade Glenn to send an email from Terri's computer to the Guardian, outlining all the snide jokes Mannion and his advisers made at Mr Tickel's expense, but end up getting incriminated themselves. Thus both political parties must now face investigation.	tt0459159	The Thick of It

First witness is Pearson, whose obscure jargonese strikes the panel as being at odds with his role as an information giver, whilst Tucker is reprimanded for trying to score political points. It soon becomes apparent that opposing sides are using the inquiry to discredit each other whilst those who sent the emails do a good job of discrediting themselves.

The local Council government belongs to Hacker's party and he doesn't want to make waves but Sir Humphrey is insistent.

When his boss Jennifer Taylor-Clark drops in she tells him that the company can no longer afford both a Swindon and a Slough branch and that one is to be merged into the other. She also tells him there are going to be redundancies. Word spreads through the office quickly but David assures everyone that their jobs are safe.	tt0290978	The Office
11313	1	2	Work Experience	16 Jul. 2001	8.1	1,962	David hires Donna, his lodger and the daughter of his best friend.

11314	1	3	The Quiz	23 Jul. 2001	8.1	1,873	It is Tim's 30th birthday - he receives a card from Dawn and an unusual inflatable gift from Lee. More importantly, however, it's Quiz Night and there are reputations to be made or lost.	tt0290978	The Office
11315	1	4	Training	30 Jul. 2001	8.8	2,153	To fend off the increasing staff disillusionment a Training Day has been scheduled. Dawn's engagement to Lee is on the rocks and Tim begins to think that he may at last have a chance with her.	tt0290978	The Office
11316	1	5	New Girl	13 Aug. 2001	7.9	1,728	Tim decides there's no future for him in selling paper and decides that he going to go to university and study psychology. After staying out all night, Donna shows up for work late and after David admonishes her announces she had spent the night with someone from the office. David is also interviewing for a new secretary and given the choice of Stuart Foote and Karen Roper selects the blond Karen. Gareth gives a Health and Safety seminar, but Donna is the only employee he's invited. Chris Finch shows up at the office and they all go on their regular Wednesday outing ...	tt0290978	The Office
11317	1	6	Judgement	20 Aug. 2001	8.2	1,676	It's the day to announce the redundancies. Tim tells David he's leaving and is happy to do so. Dawn is actually hoping that she'll be one of the redundancies. When Jennifer Taylor-Clark arrives, she announces to David that she's been promoted and he is in line to replace her. It would mean however that the Slough branch would be reduced in size and bear the brunt of the redundancies. He accepts without hesitation. Gareth takes the news particularly hard. David becomes the hero when he subsequently announces that he's decided to turn down the job to save the branch.	tt0290978	The Office
11318	2	1	Merger	30 Sep. 2002	8.2	1,622	It's the day of the big merger. The Swindon branch has closed and several of the staff, including the new manager of the combined Slough Branch, Neil Godwin, arrive. Tim is comfortable in his new role as the senior sales rep while Dave and Gareth continue with their own wacky humor. Dave in particular puts his foot in it with his welcome speech of jokes and anecdotes that go over like a lead balloon. In the party afterward his racist joke leads to a complaint from one of the new intake as does his feeble attempt at humor about drugs, leading Jennifer Taylor-Clark to ...	tt0290978	The Office
11319	2	2	Appraisals	7 Oct. 2002	8.2	1,576	David is doing staff appraisals which most of the staff approach with their usual level of enthusiasm. Part of the process is for them to to give feedback on David's performance and this seems to get most of his attention. Dawn is surprised - and seemingly a bit jealous - when one of the newcomers asks if Tim has a girlfriend. David's offhand remarks sets Neil off and he lets David know exactly who is boss.	tt0290978	The Office
11320	2	3	Party	14 Oct. 2002	8.4	1,591	David takes on a new look that, not surprisingly perhaps, reflect his new boss Neil's tastes. His already over-inflated ego gets a boost when a training firm offers him a handy sum for a 15 minute training presentation. Neil on the other hand declines the same offer saying he's too busy. The office has a bit of a celebration when one of the new arrivals from Swindon has a birthday. The gifts she receives are a bit on the risqué side but David stuns everyone into silence with his feeble attempt at humor.	tt0290978	The Office
11321	2	4	Motivation	21 Oct. 2002	8.4	1,580	David's attempt at being cool includes sporting an earring. His session as a trainer arrives but his unique approach doesn't work very well. Tim and Rachel are carrying on at the office, much to Gareth's dismay. Dawn doesn't seem too pleased either. Neil takes David to task for not thinking things through before making decisions. He also tells him he's more worried about being popular than steering the ship in the right direction.	tt0290978	The Office
11322	2	5	Charity	28 Oct. 2002	8.7	1,669	It's the annual comic relief day fund raiser at the office and the employees are up to their usual silliness. Tim raises money from his mates by playing a prank on Gareth. Dawn is selling kisses at reception and the bashful Tim buys one. It leads him to reconsider his relationship with Rachel but he's devastated when he hears of her near-term plans with Lee. Others in the office have their own take on humor but David is again pushed to extremes when the ever popular Neil does a spot on John Travolta imitation from Saturday Night Fever. Humor aside, David has also ...	tt0290978	The Office
11323	2	6	Interview	4 Nov. 2002	8.7	1,631	It's David's last day and he is outwardly very calm about it all. The company has sent a writer to interview him for an article on leadership and his idea is to dictate the contents rather than answer any of her questions. He thinks he has a bright future as a trainer but gets bad news on that front as well. He tries to reverse Neil's decision but to no avail. Tim decides it's time to have a chat with Dawn. Gareth is convinced that he's in line to replace David.	tt0290978	The Office

Despite a stern warning from Gareth and wise words from Keith in Accounts, Tim can't help but get his hopes up again. Meanwhile, David Brent has been using the services of a dating agency and, in between making celebrity appearances in nightclubs, he meets up for drinks with a rather disappointing selection of single women.

Scientists have found that throughout history, the distribution of wealth is governed by hidden forces: DNA, environmental stress, patterns of human migration and even the laws of thermodynamics! Nature seems to demand winners and losers in life. But does this mean greed is king, and the rich can take what they want? Or does the cooperation among even the smallest microorganisms ...	tt1513168	Through the Wormhole

With a little imagination, could a few terrorists sabotage this massive network? Cripple a mighty nation? Perhaps even tear down modern civilization? Our increasing dependence on digital devices and global interactivity may be placing us in grave danger. Scientists around the world are dealing with new threats such as body hacking, Trojan Horse viruses, and brain-damaging Internet addiction. But what if the ultimate threat isn't an attack on technology, but the ...	tt1513168	Through the Wormhole

Could this nightmare ever become reality? Scientists have discovered pathogens that turn insects into the walking dead. New deadly strains of viruses are attacking humans every day. Mathematicians are calculating the likelihood of surviving a zombie virus outbreak. Neuroscientists are even discovering that we can easily lose conscious control of our bodies.

13555	1	5	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles	21 Jun. 2006	8.2	333	The Nerd grabs a beer and decides to review the first Ninja Turtles game for the NES. For a game that's based off of a kids show, it's not kid friendly when the platforms in the levels make it tricky for you to jump on and the rapid re-spawning of the enemies. The Nerd's main complaint is the electrifying seaweed which makes swimming under water more difficult than it seems. Not to mention that at some points in the game you're unable to get any of the turtles out of the water upon the land levels despite how they're able to swim in the underwater levels.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The game itself isn't too exciting for a game that is trying to teach kids the dangers of drugs. The most ironic thing about the game is it has a hot-line that contains a recording of what is suppose to be Wally Bear telling kids about the dangers of drugs. The hot-line is still active to this day despite that the game was released 14 years ago. The Nerd suspects that the recording lays dormant in some ..."	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

One of the hand full of NES games that come in a baby blue color cartridge. There isn't anything great about the game other than the main character being drunk hence the word drunkard in the title.

For an older flight simulating video game there isn't much to offer since it's made for the NES, but the confusing controls and lack of music makes the Nerd irritated. His main complaint goes to the landing the plane sequence which always results in the plane crashing into the ocean despite that the Nerd did his best to steer the plane in the correct coordinates.

In the dream world Freddy forces the Nerd to play the Nightmare on Elm Street game for the NES. With the generic Halloween monsters and the campy music, it was far from being as great as it's movie counterpart. The Nerd's main complaint is that the main character in the game has no weapons except for the dream sequences.

In the first part he complains about the bundle of remakes to Street Fighter 2, the spin-offs to Mega Man, and the unreleased titles to Final Fantasy. The second part of the review is where he mentions certain movie titles with confusing sequel titles or spin-offs. Particulary the Zombie movie franchise being a sequel franchise to Dawn of the Dead without George Ramero's involvement.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13566	1	16	Rocky	14 Dec. 2006	7.5	260	The Nerd is having a Rocky marathon at his apartment as a tribute to Rocky 6 coming to theaters. While five of the movies are being played on various media players in his apartment, the Nerd reviews the Rocky game for the Sega Master System. while the look of the game looks good, the game in general is too hard for a boxing genre game. No matter how many times the Nerd goes through the second match of the game, he's unable to proceed to the final match. In conclusion, the game doesn't hold up as well as Super Punch Out does.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13567	1	17	Bible Games	20 Dec. 2006	8.6	359	For his first Christmas review, the Nerd decides to review a few unlicensed Bible games for the NES and Super Nintendo. The most obscured game of the bunch would have to be Super Noah's Ark 3D. Only cause it's the only first person shooter where you get to play as Noah. The game is basically a clone of Wolfenstein 3D which is a better first person shooter to play. The Nerd is confused as to why there are so many goats inside the ark and the reason for Noah to be attacked by goats is a mystery.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13568	2	1	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Part 1	25 Jan. 2007	8.1	255	The Nerd gives us his opinion on the third Ninja Turtles movie by expressing how it's inferior towards the first two movies and the cartoon series. Before he goes into a deep review on the film, he talks a little about the impact the franchise had in America while going over the first two movies. The only way he was able to show how he feels about the movie is by comparing the action, quotes, and story of the third movie to it's predecessors making a point in how the trilogy decline.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13569	2	2	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Part 2	25 Jan. 2007	8.2	228	After finishing his review on the third movie the only way the Nerd will feel satisfied with himself is by destroying his Ninja Turtles 3 VHS tape. By doing so is by using a katana to slice it in half and then smash it with a hammer until it is nothing more than a pile of shredded scraps of plastic and paper. After doing this the Nerd felt like that Justice has been served for all Ninja Turtle fans out there.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13570	2	3	Atari 5200	13 Feb. 2007	8.2	268	The Nerd shows clips of various games to the Atari 2600 and expresses how it defines the term classic video games. He mentions that there were successors to the console that came and disappear within a couple years. Like the 5200 that was meant to replace the 2600, but it failed and eventually faded from the market. The main reason was because of the size of the console and AC adapter. While hooking it up to the TV with it's limited cable range makes it a real chore.

When he fails at beating his own game, they move on to an NES version... which is also a piece of crap. The Game Boy game is the worst of all, as Spidey fails to beat it while dangling from the Nerd's ceiling. To top it all off, the Nerd plays the Spider-Man 2 game for Game Boy Advance, which is decent enough, except it depicts Spidey as a pizza delivery boy.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

13577	2	10	Silver Surfer	5 Jun. 2007	8.2	260	The AVGN tackles one of the hardest games in the NES library: Silver Surfer. What makes it so hard is that SS dies with a single hit, and the levels are packed to the brims with obstacles, projectiles and inconsistent scenery. If you touch anything, game over.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13578	2	11	Die Hard	19 Jun. 2007	8.0	241	The Nerd fins the front cover of the Die Hard game to be a little controversial due to it depicting a skyscraper being blown up which he advices that we all know what it reminds us of. Though he puts that issue aside and starts playing the game on his NES. While the terrorists in the game are able to take 3/4's of John McClain's health away, the Nerd's biggest complaint for the game is the dark areas that only light up when you enter the area which makes it inconvenient when there's a terrorist lurking in that area and you don't know it unless you go into that area. ...	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13579	2	12	Independence Day	4 Jul. 2007	7.0	233	The Nerd reviews Independence Day for Playstation 1 and it's basically an average flight simulator like any other video game that involves flight simulator. The main complaint the Nerd has for the game is that objects don't appear until you're a few feet in front of them. While getting items on the ground is suicide cause it's hard to not touch the ground without taking some damage. The Nerd concludes the game with wishing everyone a great Fourth of July but advices everyone to stay away from the Independence Day game.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The Nerd reviews Bugs Bunny's Birthday Blowout which is nothing more than a poor man's Super Mario Bros. style slide scroller game. While the game is generous of providing extra lives, it however suffers from being unorganized by having breakable blocks placed over bottom-less pits and enemies that can hurt you even if you hurt them.

The game in general is ""Custard's Revenge"" which like the other Atari adult games was unlicensed and the Atari company had nothing to do with them. And just for fun, the Nerd reviews other Atari adult games only to find that each one either made no sense in how the game play is mastered or how the ideas for the games looked like they were thought up by sick minded game developers."	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The Nerd praises it for being the earliest way to know how to beat the toughest Nintendo games. Before the Internet became more common to use the only way to know how to beat a game is by magazine subscription.

The one that caught the Nerd's attention was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the Atari 2600. After negotiating with the red neck, the Nerd got the game along with another rare 2600 game for free. The Nerd returns home with his newly bought 2600 games and starts to play the Leatherface game first.

The game the Nerd got as a bonus when he purchased the Leatherface game from the crazed red neck that knocked him out with a banjo.

For this one he talks about the Zelda games made up to the year 2008. And tries to piece together how each of them fit as one whole time-line. Only to discover that most of them are less connected than the other. Which in the end he concludes that the franchise doesn't need to have a well explained time-line when each game is worth playing without knowing what occurred in any of the other games.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13591	2	24	Rambo	22 Jan. 2008	7.8	229	With the upcoming release of the fourth Rambo movie, the Nerd reviews Rambo for the NES. The game suffers from four problems which are: confusing navigation on the landscapes, pointless chat options, unnecessary use of animals as enemies, and the idea of the screen blinking red when low on health. The Nerd also reviews some other Rambo games but couldn't find a single one that actually is fun to play. He feels the games should of taken advice from Contra on how to make a commando theme game more fun.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

Mainly due to the addition of weird enemies and locations that don't look like something you'd find in either the movie or the original books. The Nerd's main complaint is the large number of glitches the game has where various platforms make the characters in the game fall through. While playing the game, the Nerd is visited by the Cowardly Lion who won't shut up through out the review.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

He starts his review on Intellivision first and also does a review on most of its games. His main complaint is the controller for the Intellivision makes playing the games harder. Despite how most of Intellivision's games are knock offs of already popular Atari games. He's also amused by the fuzzy sound quality of the voice synthesizer that is only compatible to certain Intellivision games.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13595	3	4	Double Vision: Part 2	8 Apr. 2008	7.9	216	The Nerd does a follow up to the previous review by showing us the features of the Colecovision. The controllers aren't any different from the Intellivision, while most of the games are as bad they look. His main complaint is one of the add-ons to the console is a device that allows you to play Atari 2600 games on the Colecovision. The Nerd found it hard to believe the competitor of Atari was allowed to sell such a device. Cause in today's gaming market it wouldn't be allowed when it can create multiple lawsuits.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

While the Nerd doesn't find the story for The Wizard to be great, he did admit that it holds a place in the gaming community. After putting his review on the Wizard aside he starts to play Super Mario Bros. 3, while it has a lot of hard parts it is really fun to play, however the Nerd couldn't help but notice the game ...	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The most absurd one he can find is the 25th Anniversary game for the NES which consists of pointless dialog and confusing quests, the Nerd thought about destroying it with a phaser but had a change of heart believing that the game developers tried their hardiest when making the game.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

While the Superman game for the NES is another story where all of the characters are drawn in a chibi style and the use of attacks don't do justice towards the enemies. The Nerd's biggest complete about the game is that one of the missions involve trying to see why the stocks are so low in the stock market.

His main complaint is the load time takes forever and he finds the Commodore controller to be so stiff that he resulted in using an alternate controller. After that he does review Superman 64 for the Nintendo 64 as the fans wished him to do so in the first place. Once he dived into the first level he already finds it to be terrible when all you do is fly through rings under a short time limit.

Out of the three he decides to play Zelda: Wand of Gamelon first cause the Nerd thought it be cool to control Zelda in a Zelda game for once since her name is on every single Zelda game. The Nerd soon finds out that the game is nothing like the Nintendo licensed Zelda games. Instead the game has bad animation, poor voice acting, complicated controls, confusing layouts of the levels, and frustrating use of items.

While the final game the Nerd reviews is Zelda's Adventure, which he praises it for not having the same bad animation as the first two games and is now an over head view like the earlier Zelda games instead of a slide scroller game.

As he plays the game the one thing he finds annoying is fact you have to check every single door and window to find a lost kid to rescue while The Nerd couldn't understand why some copies of the game have the Thriller theme while others don't.

It's for the cassette tape player for the Commodore 64 which gives you a playable game. However it's not what you'd expect for a Transformers video game. It's mostly a simulation game with target shooting theme levels. There was a slide scroller game made for Transformers except it's a Japanese only game.

The Nerd didn't like the idea of Luigi being in a learning game especially one that has bad controls and missions that make no sense like New York being concern that King Kong was abducted.

The Nerd dislikes how the level layouts of the game make little sense such as ladders leading to no where and anti-gravity lakes with no bottom except for thin air. The Nerd's main complaint is almost all of the items are invisible and only appear if you jump on a certain spot. This becomes annoying when all you do in the game is jump around in every single area.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

So the Nerd couldn't help but check out what the NES game is like. The game is already a big downer when there's a lack of good color and the Nerd's main complaint is that Garth has an effective weapon while Wayne just gives out a wimpy kick.

13633	4	19	Little Red Hood	3 Dec. 2009	7.6	196	Out of all of the NES games in his collection, the Nerd decides to review the one that stands out like a sore thumb which has an unusual slot on top of the cartridge. Mainly because it's an unlicensed game much like the Noah's Ark 3D game for the Super Nintendo. The game is called Little Red Hood, which in no way does it resemble the original story. So the Nerd starts to play it and already could tell it's an abomination with putrid color schemes and unusual game rules. In fact the game has no organized rules when enemies re-spawn rapidly, items would sometimes ...	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The Nerd explains how the Winter Games for the Atari 2600 was fun, however the NES version is inferior due to it having only four winter Olympic game events and has a bad control scheme. The biggest complaint the Nerd has for the game is the figure skating game in which no matter what buttons he presses he is unable to achieve any good skating moves and always receives a 0.0 for a score despite managing to pull off a few good skating ...	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The Nerd strives to beat this ridiculously hard game that has nothing to do with the Street Fighter series, and as a bonus, he plays not only the Sega Saturn adaptation of the Street Fighter movie, but he actually manages to find and play the original Street Fighter game!

The Nerd points out that while the game looks like a rip off of Legend of Zelda, its actually older than Zelda. It was originally released as a computer game but got re-released for the NES at the wake of the first Zelda game. Excluding the similarities to Zelda, the game is nothing special. The Nerd's main complaint is the confusing selection of options on the menu screen and the use of long passwords in order to beat the game. When a save feature would of ...	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd
13637	4	23	Ninja Gaiden	4 Feb. 2010	7.9	210	Ninja Gaiden is one of the Nerd's favorite games, but its extreme difficulty has prevented him from beating it.

Only three games were made when it was planned to be a four game series. However due to the 1983 video game crash, Atari pulled the plug on the production of the fourth and final game and the two remaining contests never happened.

In this case he reviews every single Pong console he can obtain. Most of these console don't have insert slots for games because the games are already programmed into the consoles themselves. Most of the consoles would either not work properly or have unusual features during the game play. The most obscure consoles are the ones that don't have an AC adapter outlet which makes hooking the consoles up a big chore. The Nerd expressed how times ...	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

The game is an unlicensed NES game compiled with 52 games. This seem to be a cool idea, until the Nerd discovers what those games are. So he does a marathon run on the first 51 games and every single one either has characters dying in mid-air, characters too small to identify, too many space shooter genre games, games that make no sense, enemies that don't die, games that keep crashing, & whole bunch of other disastrous elements.

It looked like the best game cause all of the efforts seem to be poured into it the most compared to the other games. However the game isn't any better than the other 51 games. It suffers from unusual glitches and the attack moves are worthless to certain enemies. After finishing all 52 games, the Nerd decided to play the unreleased Cheetah Men 2 game.

As he starts off playing the game he points out a few tips on how to play the game longer, except doing so is a real chore.

The Nerd knows that the game isn't going to be fun just by seeing the main title screen and the intro. What perplexes the Nerd is that Lester is a wimpy guy who can't attack with anything but a puny kick, unable to with stand jumping from a high place, and is afraid of almost everything he encounters. To make matters worse, the levels of the game look like they're design for a more playable plat-former game with a character that isn't as weak as Lester.

The Nerd's main complaint about the game is the constant reusing of only three dream worlds which are a Medievil World, Roman World, and the Wild West. While the levels themselves have no logic when it comes to item locations and the number of hits it takes to kill an enemy. This game is so bad that the Nerd would rather dream of playing a better game than Day Dreamin' Davey.	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

When it comes to Star Wars, it's such a huge franchise that making video game adaptations is a good way to expand it. Doing this task lead to certain video game developers to develop both hard and unusual Star Wars games. The hardest game the Nerd plays is the Famicon version which gives you no life bar and only three continues and a start-all-over-from-the-beginning type of game.

Starting with Jaws for the NES, which the Nerd complains that the concept is boring when all you do is collect sea shells in order to get power ups that'll allow you to kill the shark quicker. The second game he reviews is Hook for the NES, which is sadly a poorly executed plat-former game resembling nothing like the movie.

The Nerd reviews the game and already finds the title to be misleading when the main character looks nothing like the one on the cartridge cover and it's no where close to being ""cool"". The Nerd's main complaint is the jumping controls aren't that responsive and random placements of hidden item blocks which creates a hazard when trying to jump to another area or trying to jump on enemies."	tt1230180	The Angry Video Game Nerd

And to honor his return to reviewing bad and challenging games, he decides to review some Schwarzenegger games for the NES. Mainly due to Schwarzenegger returning to acting after finishing his term as Governer. When it comes to Arnold, his action films are always appealing to watch. As for video game adaptations it's the complete opposite. They either don't feature the main character to resemble Arnold or the game-play and level layouts are a complete mess.

After getting requests to do a review on sports games, the Nerd complies to his fans by playing Atari sport genre games. Mainly cause those are the first sports games made for a home console.
